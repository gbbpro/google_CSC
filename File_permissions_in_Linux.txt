File permissions in Linux
Project description
examine existing permissions on the file system to see  if the permissions match the authorization that should be given. If they do not match -  modify the permissions to authorize the appropriate users and remove any unauthorized access.
Check file and directory details
ls -l
Describe the permissions string
drwx--x--- “this is a directory noted by the first position “d” the user has read, write & executable permissions, the group has executable permissions only, and others can not read,  write or execute this directory”


Change file permissions
                                   
*         project_k.txt
         
   *                 User = read, write,                 
   *                 Group = read, write
   *                 Other = read, write
-rw-rw-rw researcher2 research project_k.txt


Chmod o-rw project_k.txt


The chmod command is taking away read and write privileges from the owner group


ls -l


-rw-rw— researcher2 research project_k.txt
 




Change file permissions on a hidden file
                                   
   *         .project_x.txt
         
      *                 User = read, write
      *                 Group = write
      *                 Other = none
chmod u-w, g-w,g+r .project_x.txt
This chmod command first removes the write permissions from the user, then removes write privileges from the group and then adds read permissions to the group


Change directory permissions


                                   
There is also one subdirectory inside the projects directory named drafts. The permissions on drafts are:
      *         User = read, write, execute
      *         Group = execute
      *         Other = none
The files and directories in the projects directory belong to the researcher2 user. Only researcher2 should be allowed to access the drafts directory and its contents. Use a Linux command to modify the permissions accordingly.
chmod g-x drafts


This command removes the executable permissions from the group
Summary
While reviewing authorizations in projects directory I found some files and a directory that needed to be modified:
      * While in the project directory I modified authorization to:
      * project_k.txt - this file contains information not for general use the authorizations were to - -rw-rw— researcher2 research project_k.txt
      * .project_x.txt is an archived file write authorization was removed from all and read authorization was added to the group
      * Finally the drafts directory authorization was removed from all except the user “researcher2”

Using the chmod command you can modifiy who is authorized to read, write to, excute a file or directory.

the structure of user, group, other is visualised when you use the ls or list command with the argument -l  this will show you the permissions before the file like so:
     * -rwxrwxrwx translates to - = file, first three rwx represent the user; next three represent the group and the final represent everyone else or other.  r = read - w = write - x = execute.  - or d at the beginning signify if it is a file - or a directory d.  if the user field was -w- then the user could only write to the file or directory, but could not read or execute.  if the group should only have read permissions for a file the that section would read r--  
     * the following is a folder that is read write execute for the user only and no one else drwx------
     * dotfiles or . files like .venv or .bashrc are hidden files in a directory if you want to list them then you would need to add the -a argument to the ls command like so ls -a or ls -la to also see the permissions
