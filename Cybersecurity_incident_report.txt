Cybersecurity Incident Report


Section 1: Identify the type of attack that may have caused this 
network interruption
	One potential explanation for the website's connection timeout error message is:  a DoS attack. The logs show that: there were a large number of TCP SYN requests coming from an unfamiliar IP address. The web server appears to be overwhelmed by the volume of incoming traffic and is losing its ability to respond to the abnormally large number of SYN requests. This event could be: SYN DoS attack.


	

Section 2: Explain how the attack is causing the website to malfunction
	When website visitors try to establish a connection with the web server, a three-way handshake occurs using the TCP protocol. Explain the three steps of the handshake:
1. A SYN packet is sent from the source to the destination requesting a connection


2.  The destination will send a SYN ACK request back and reserve resources for the connection


3. The final ACK package is sent back from the source to the destination to acknowledging the connection


Explain what happens when a malicious actor sends a large number of SYN packets all at once:


Explain what the logs indicate and how that affects the server:  when a malicious actor sends an attack like this the server is flooded with SYN packets, when the SYN ACK is sent back it is ignored by the source so new connections will not be available to visitors.
